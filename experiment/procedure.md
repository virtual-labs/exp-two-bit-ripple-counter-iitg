### Procedure
1. Choose the IC to use in the experiment – place the component on the breadboard.

2. Connect the inputs of the IC to the logic sources and its output to the logic indicators – make the wire connections between the various components.

3. Apply various input combinations and observe output for each one – use the DIP switches to apply various input combinations and note the LED indicators.

4. Verify the truth table for each input/output combination.

5. Exit the experiment when done – use the “Close” button to exit.
